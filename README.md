 # Universal Energy Extraction Limit in Open-Channel Flow

This repository hosts the official public webpage and supporting materials
for the analytical result identifying a universal energy extraction limit
in ideal open-channel flow.

## Key Result

A universal subcritical extremum of extractable energy occurs at the
Froude number:

**Fr ≈ 0.3094**

At this value, the maximum extractable energy fraction reaches:

**η ≈ 34.52%**

This limit is derived analytically from energy balance considerations and
is independent of empirical resistance laws or friction models.

The result is conceptually analogous to the Betz limit in wind energy,
but applies to free-surface open-channel flows.
