    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The ERGroup Small Hydropower Project is a pilot micro-hydropower installation 
        located in the Kibray district of Tashkent region, Uzbekistan. 
        The system is installed directly on an existing irrigation canal 
        without the construction of dams or alteration of water flow regimes.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
        The pilot unit has already been installed and tested using the team's own resources.
        Current output reaches up to 5 kW, with planned expansion to 8–10 kW.
    </div>

    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>
        The system uses a free-flow hydro turbine optimized for low-head and 
        moderate-flow irrigation channels. The design focuses on:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>High energy extraction efficiency</li>
        <li>Minimal environmental impact</li>
        <li>No need for dam construction</li>
        <li>Low operational and maintenance costs</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The turbine geometry is based on proprietary research aimed at improving 
        power output by 20–30% compared to conventional free-flow systems.
    </p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>
        Uzbekistan has thousands of kilometers of irrigation canals with stable water flow. 
        Installing micro-hydropower units on suitable sections can provide:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Distributed renewable electricity</li>
        <li>Reduced CO₂ emissions</li>
        <li>Energy support for rural communities</li>
        <li>Scalable decentralized infrastructure</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
    <p>
        The project operates without blocking fish migration, without 
        modifying hydrological regimes, and without flooding land areas. 
        It represents a low-carbon and environmentally safe energy solution.
    </p>

    <h2>Scalability</h2>
    <p>
        The pilot installation serves as a demonstration model. 
        After optimization, the design can be replicated on similar 
        irrigation canals across Uzbekistan and other countries 
        with comparable hydraulic infrastructure.
    </p>

    <h2>Current Status</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pilot turbine installed</li>
        <li>Generator and inverter connected</li>
        <li>Operational testing completed</li>
        <li>Optimization phase ongoing</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Video demonstration and additional technical materials are available upon request.
